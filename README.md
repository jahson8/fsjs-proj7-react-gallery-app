# React Gallery App

For this project, the very popular and in-demand React library was used to create an image gallery app. With the help of this powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app was built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

In this project I:

- Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
- Used React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
- Used the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and use it to display images in your app.
- Added logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
- Added to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
